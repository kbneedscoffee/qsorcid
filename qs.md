## Introduction
### What is ORCID?

The [Open Researcher and Contributor ID](orcid.org/), most commonly known as ORCID, is a 16-digit unique identifier designed for researchers. ORCID is an open non-profit and community-based effort to create and maintain a registry of these identifiers. ORCID also provides transparent methods to link research activities and outputs to identifiers.

### Benefits of an ORCID

ORCIDs are designed as lifelong identifiers. It may be helpful to think of them like social security numbers for your research portfolio. If your name changes or if you move institutions, your identifier remains the same.

As unique identifiers, ORCIDs aim to prevent authorship confusion. Individuals with common names such as Jane Smith may be familiar with the experience of having another’s work attributed incorrectly to their name, and vice versa.

ORCID is not limited to specific platforms and non-proprietary. ORCID is linked to several identifier systems such as LinkedIn, Scopus Author ID, and ResearcherID. It is also connected to publishers such as Nature and funding agencies such as Wellcome Trust. 


## Getting started

### Visibility
When changes are made to any of the fields described below, ORCID offers two selection options for visibility: **Edit all visibility settings** and **Edit individual visibility**. The options are the same described in 2.2 Creating an ORCID iD.

Making changes to **Edit all visibility** will change all field settings to match your selection. For example, if you select *Only me*, no one else will be able to view details on your profile.

Making changes to **Edit individual visibility** will change the visibility of the selected field. For example, if you update the Country field and select *Everyone*, all users will be able to view what country you reside in.

There are six options for how to add works to your ORCID profile:
- Search & link
- Add ArXiv ID (Identifier)
- Add DOI (Identifier)
- Add PubMed ID (Identifier)
- Import BibTeX
- + Add manually

**Search & link**: ORCID is connected to several member organizations that have built-in search and link tools that allow the direct import of information about publications and other works. For a full list of organizations, see [Add works by direct import from other systems](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems).

**Identifiers (ArXiv ID, DOI, PubMed ID)**: If a work has an existing identifier, you can use the identifier to import information about the work. Enter the identifier into the Add work form and it will auto-populate the form with the work’s information.

**Import BibTeX**: The BibTeX import tool is for importing works from systems that do not have pre-existing connections with ORCID., such as Google Scholar Citations. For in-depth support, view [Import works using BibTeX](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006894794-Importing-works-from-a-BibTeX-file).

**+ Add manually**: If a work does not have an identifier or is not in another ORCID compatible system, you may choose to add it manually. There are four work categories to choose from: 
Publication
Conference
Intellectual property
Other

Depending on the selected category, a number of work types will appear in the dropdown. For support selecting a work type, view [supported work types under Metadata in the ORCID Integration and API FAQ](https://info.orcid.org/documentation/integration-and-api-faq/#easy-faq-2682).
